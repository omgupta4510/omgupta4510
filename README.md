✨ “Happiness is a design decision. I architect workflows, products and tools that reduce friction, amplify clarity, and encourage sustainable choices.” ✨

### ☀️ Micro-Identity (Who I Am in 7 Words)
Engineer • Optimizer • Sustainability Minded • Joy Architect

---

### 🌀 Operating Principles (My Personal "Runtime")
| Principle | Translation to Code Life | Result |
|-----------|--------------------------|--------|
| Reduce entropy | Automate repetitive friction | More creative energy |
| Build with empathy | Clear docs, accessible UX | Inclusive adoption |
| Measure impact | LCA, metrics, iteration loops | Continuous improvement |
| Default to optimism | Seek possibility over limitation | Momentum |
| Ship tiny joys | Surprise & delight in details | Emotional stickiness |
| Design for sustainability | Conscious architecture choices | Lower footprint |
| Happiness is modular | Assemble your day intentionally | Resilience |

---

### 🌍 Current Focus Universe
```text
[ CORE ]  LCA Tooling • AI × Packaging Sustainability
[ R&D  ]  UX for Environmental Decisions • Data Visualization
[ LAB  ]  Emotional design patterns • Joyful automation rituals
```

---

### 🎨 The "Happy Stack"
| Layer | Tooling / Concepts | Emotional Intent |
|-------|--------------------|------------------|
| Interface | React, Tailwind, Accessible Components | Calm clarity |
| Logic | Node.js, Python ML modules | Expressive reasoning |
| Intelligence | Model-assisted decisions (AI hints) | Reduce cognitive load |
| Integrity | CI sanity checks, typed boundaries | Trustworthiness |
| Sustainability | LCA modeling patterns | Responsibility |
| Joy Layer | Subtle animations, clean typography | Lightness |

### 🌱 Featured Impactful Builds

#### 🌿 LCA Tool
Quantifying environmental impact so choices become obvious.  
Focus: Transparent calculations • Visual impact layers • Scenario modeling.

#### 🤖 AI Packaging Tool
Helping packaging decisions become smarter + greener.  
Focus: Intelligent suggestions • Waste reduction • Optimization loops.

#### 🔥 Agni2025
Exploratory initiative for forward-looking solutions (2025+ vision prototypes).

#### 🎛 Packgine Frontend
Interface experiments in clarity, micro-joy and environmental literacy.

---

### 🧪 Joy Experiments (Active)
| Experiment | Description | Status |
|------------|-------------|--------|
| Mood-driven accent color | UI palette shifts based on a daily retrieval action | Designing |
| “One-Less-Waste” prompt | Daily nudge to eliminate a wasteful pattern | Trial |
| Gratitude commit footer | Optional `#grateful:` annotated commits | Manual |
| Flow blocks | 90/20 focus rhythms in timer plugin | Practicing |

---

### 📦 Happiness-Oriented Dev Artifacts
```yaml
tooling:
  rituals:
    - "Daily micro-retro at 19:00"
    - "Commit message clarity > brevity"
    - "Green energy hours scheduling (where possible)"
  emotional_instrumentation:
    - "Lightweight friction log"
    - "Energy check-in before deep work"
    - "Weekly 'remove one drag' refactor"
```

---

### 🔄 Dynamic Zones (Optional Automations You Can Add)
These can be powered by GitHub Actions + small scripts (ask me and I'll generate them):

1. Daily Happiness Quote (auto-injected below)
2. “One Sustainable Tip” rotation
3. Visualization of your weekly “commit mood pattern”
4. Rolling 7-day “time-in-flow” scoreboard (manual journaling → JSON → badge)

#### 🌞 Today’s Happiness Byte (placeholder)
> “Simplicity is compassionate. Complexity is rarely kind.”

---

### 🧭 My North Star / Why I Build
Because tools shape decisions—and if tools are built with care, insight and generosity, they become quiet companions that help people choose better for themselves and the planet.

---

### ⚙️ Potential GitHub Action: Daily Quote Injector (Optional)
Add a file `.github/workflows/daily-quote.yml` + a small script that rewrites a marker between:
`<!--QUOTE_START--> ... <!--QUOTE_END-->`.

Want this? Ping me: I’ll scaffold it.

### 💬 Interaction Map
| If you want... | Reach out about |
|----------------|-----------------|
| To collaborate | LCA model integration, AI assist layers |
| To learn | Sustainable system design decisions |
| To brainstorm | Productizing environmental insights |
| To jam on | Joyful developer experience patterns |

### ☁️ Ambient Metrics (Philosophical)
```text
CLARITY LEVEL      ████████▓░  (improving)
JOY RESONANCE      ███████░░░  (needs more animation)
SUSTAIN IMPACT     ████████░░  (expanding)
EXPERIMENT THROUGHPUT  steady
REFRACTORING DRAG  minimized weekly
```

### 🧘 Happiness Footnote
Happiness isn’t an outcome—it’s architectural. You can scaffold for it: remove friction, add meaning, align efforts with values, and honor recovery.
