# Choose To Be Happy 😁
### Engineering sustainable, intelligent, calm software systems

</div>

## 👋 About Me
I’m Om — I build clean, purpose‑driven tools at the intersection of:  
- ♻️ Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) & sustainability  
- 🤖 Practical AI assistance (substance over hype)  
- 🧩 Clear, low-friction user experience  

I focus on reducing cognitive and environmental waste.  
Great software should feel: **understandable · maintainable · responsible · light**.

## 🎯 Current Focus
| Area | What I’m Doing | Outcome Target |
|------|----------------|----------------|
| 🌍 LCA Tooling | Modeling & surfacing environmental impact data | Actionable visibility |
| 📦 AI for Packaging | Suggesting lower-waste packaging decisions | Reduced material waste |
| 🔬 Agni2025 | Future-facing prototypes & architectural experiments | Validated innovation paths |
| 🧪 Packgine Frontend | Calm, accessible interaction patterns | Lower decision friction |

## 🧭 Engineering Principles
```
Clarity           > cleverness
Sustainability    > disposability
Consistency       > fragmentation
Small iteration   > silent mega-rewrite
Explicit naming   > inferred intent
Measured progress > aesthetic churn
Calm interfaces   > attention theatre
```

---

## 🧪 How I Work
- Design from the “decision surface” backward (what must the user confidently choose?)
- Use explicit domain language (code + UI align)
- Treat sustainability metrics as first‑class signals
- Automate only after patterns stabilize
- Remove one friction item per iteration
- Leave every module slightly clearer than I found it

## 💡 Light Philosophy
> Happiness (in engineering) = removing unnecessary weight while preserving meaning & direction.
