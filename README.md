#  Choose To Be Happy  
### I build tools that make better (and lighter) choices easier.

“Happy” for me = clarity, sustainability, kindness in design, and small sparks of delight.

</div>

---

### ☀️ What I’m Doing
- Crafting sustainability + LCA tooling (make impact visible)
- Adding gentle intelligence (AI where it reduces friction)
- Designing interfaces that feel calm, honest, human

---

### 💛 Core Philosophy
Happiness is not a reward at the end — it’s a design constraint.
So I try to:
- remove friction
- keep things understandable
- choose defaults that are kind
- celebrate “enough,” not “endless”
- leave things a bit lighter than I found them

### 🔧 Active Projects (Mini Snapshots)

**LCA Tool**  
Helps quantify environmental impact so decisions aren’t guesses.

**AI Packaging Tool**  
Guides smarter packaging choices (less waste, more sense).

**Agni2025**  
Exploration space: future-facing experiments.

**Packgine Frontend**  
Interface experiments in clarity + sustainable literacy.

### 🌿 Small Practices
```
slow > rushed
clear > clever
kind > defensive
repair > discard
iterate > perfect
breathe > grind
```

---

### 🫧 Light Mood Panel (manual, intentional)
```
focus: steady
energy: grounded
joy-signal: building useful quiet tools
```

### 🌼 Today’s Tiny Byte
> “Happiness isn’t louder — it’s easier to carry.”

(You can automate this later with a GitHub Action if you want.)

---

### 🛠 Possible Next Happy Enhancements (Optional)
- rotating “tiny byte” quote (auto-update)
- mood color accent (changes weekly)
- “one less waste” log (small wins section)

Tell me which (if any) you want and I’ll scaffold code/workflows.
